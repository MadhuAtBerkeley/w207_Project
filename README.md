# w207 Project: Facial Keypoints Detection
**Authors:** Madhu Hegde and Jane Hung  
**Date:** 6 Dec 2020

## Objective
Detect facial keypoints (x-, y-coordinates) according to images of faces. Taken from this [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection).

## Goal
Reduce our RMSE below our initial baseline NN model.

## Folder Structure
- `/input`: contains training and test data
- `/output`: contains stored model and history data
- `/reference`: contains information on how to submit to Kaggle
- `/source`: contains model building code
- `/requirements.txt`: contains package requirements to recreate our findings
## Reproducibility
1. Run `source/w207_eda.ipynb` to understand how we've explored this dataset.
2. Run `source/w207_project.ipynb` to run through our feature engineering and modeling pipeline.
